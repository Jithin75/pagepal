### This repository has only the code and has been cloned for completeness of my profile, the actual repositary with working links to wiki pages for the documentations and release notes is: https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jjothikr/pagepal

### Overview:

Welcome to PagePal – the all-in-one application designed to transform your reading experience. In today’s fast-paced world, finding time to read and tracking your reading habits can be challenging. PagePal is here to simplify your literary journey, offering a seamless, integrated platform that caters to book lovers seeking to optimize and personalize their reading adventure.

With PagePal, you can track your reading progress, manage your book collection, receive AI-powered personalized book recommendations, and set reading goals. Our goal is to create a cohesive and satisfying reading experience for our users, making reading more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

### NOTE: The support for the AI-powered reccomendation will stop after May 16th 2024, since the API key that we use will expire and the OPEN AI plan does not offer any more free packages. Thank You for understanding!

### Advanced Features:

We were able to achieve the following advanced features:
- Utilize data from an existing cloud service (e.g. search Twitter data; load image data from Google; lookup names of Pokemon on a custom REST service). See the list below for some potential APIs.
- Deploy your database to the cloud to store private data. Implement appropriate privacy/security measures (e.g. hashed and encrypted password; secure authentication using tokens).
- Support multi-user scenarios. This means supporting different users, each with their own data, stored in the cloud (must be paired with some cloud deployment, as above).
- Support single-user multi-device scenarios. This requires the ability to have your data shared across different instances of your application running concurrently (must be paired with some cloud deployment as above).
